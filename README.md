# VBA-Challenge
You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel expert! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

## Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:
* The ticker symbol
* Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
* The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image: ![image](https://github.com/hannahkollmann/VBA-challenge/assets/157349641/99a3907f-ff0b-4dce-b917-fa8482ec0104)
* Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image: ![image](https://github.com/hannahkollmann/VBA-challenge/assets/157349641/222cf6d5-2fb6-4059-bfb2-32a33828eb3d)
* Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.
