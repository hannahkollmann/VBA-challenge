# VBA-Challenge
Module 2 Challenge - In this assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
-The ticker symbol
-Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
-The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
-The total stock volume of the stock.
-Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume"
-Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
